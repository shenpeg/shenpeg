### 👋 Hi, I’m Peggy!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying information systems + art @ carnegie mellon university
- 👀 I’m interested in how those 2 disciplines intersect- whether through data visualization, net art, AI-generations, or more
- 💻 My github features some of my web development and video game projects
- 💡 You can also find more art + design work on my [Portfolio](https://peggys.work) & [Medium](https://medium.com/@peggyyshen)
